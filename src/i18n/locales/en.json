    "badge": "FAQ",
    "q1": "What are the requirements for company formation in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia?",
    "a1": "Requirements vary by jurisdiction and business type. Generally, you'll need valid passports, proposed business names, a registered address, and a business plan.

    "q3": "Can foreigners own 100% of a company in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia?",
    "a3": "Yes, Bahrain allows 100% foreign ownership for most business sectors. Saudi Arabia also permits 100% foreign ownership for most activities under the new investment regulations. Some restricted sectors may require local partnership, which we can help structure appropriately.",
    "q4": "What types of business licenses are available?",
    "a4": "We can help you obtain commercial, industrial, service, tourism, and professional licenses. The specific license depends on your business activities. We assess your needs and recommend the most suitable license type for your operations.",
    "q5": "Do you provide office space and business address services?",

    "q6": "What ongoing support do you provide after company formation?",
    "a6": "We offer comprehensive post-formation support including annual license renewals, visa processing, accounting services, compliance management, and business advisory. Our relationship doesn't end at registration – we're your long-term partner for success in the Gulf.",
    "q7": "What are the costs involved in setting up a business?",

We provide detailed cost breakdowns during consultation with no hidden charges.",
    "q8": "Do I need to be physically present during the setup process?",
    "a8": "Physical presence requirements vary by jurisdiction. For Bahrain, initial presence may be required for bank account opening and biometric registration. Saudi Arabia often requires presence for final documentation. However, we minimize your time commitment through efficient scheduling and can handle most procedures with power of attorney.",
    "q9": "What banking options are available for my business?",
    "a9": "We work with all major banks in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia including local and international institutions.

    "q11": "Can I hire international employees for my company?",
    "a11": "Yes, both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia allow hiring international employees. We handle work permit applications, visa processing, and ensure compliance with labor regulations including Saudization requirements in Saudi Arabia. We guide you through quota systems, salary requirements, and all employment documentation.",
    "q12": "What happens if I want to close or transfer my business?",
    "a12": "We assist with business closure procedures including license cancellation, employee settlements, and final clearances from government authorities. For business transfers, we manage the entire ownership transfer process, ensuring legal compliance and smooth transition. Exit procedures typically take 2-4 weeks depending on business complexity."
